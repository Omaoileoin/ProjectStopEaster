Oh no! The Easter Bunny has stolen all of your eggs and hidden them in his Multi-Level Hedge Maze Supervillain Layer™! 
He even tricked baby chicks into being his evil minions and guard the eggs. The only way to defeat the chicks and get past 
the Easter Bunny is by eating the Super Chicken Grain™ scattered around the maze. If you try taking on the chicks or getting 
past the Easter Bunny without your Super Chicken Buff™, you will surely be defeated. But be careful! If you eat the wrong grain, 
it could counteract the Super Chicken Buff™ or even kill you! Defeating a chick will exhaust your Super Chicken Buff™, and you 
will need a new one before taking on the next chick. Choose your path wisely and don't waste buffs unnecessarily. Win by 
collecting all of your eggs and making it out of the Multi-Level Hedge Maze Suppervillain Layer™. Die or get captured and 
you lose. The Easter Bunny will dye your eggs and give them to little girls and boys for egg hunts. Oh the humanity...


Game Parameters

The game has three levels in the form of mazes. Each level gets progressively bigger and therefore harder to navigate. 
The walls, which are implemented with 2d arrays, are also rendered with an image of ivy on top of the wall image, giving it the 
appearance of a hedge maze. The player takes the form of a chicken, and the enemy is the Easter Bunny. Player movement uses the 
WASD keys to move up, left, down, and right. Scattered around each level are good grain, poison grain, baby chicks, and eggs - all 
implemented with 2d arrays. All of the eggs must be collected before you can move to the next level. You must gather the good grain, 
which changes the player's appearance to a "buff chicken", before you can defeat the chicks to gather the eggs or get past the Easter Bunny blocking 
the exit to the next level. The exit tile is disguised as a floor tile that looks like an opening in the maze. This gives the game 
a more realistic look when moving to the next level. When the game is over, different end screens and text appear depending on the 
result of the game.

**Current bug let's you go to the next level and end the game without collecting all of the eggs. I could not figure out how to
fix this. Because of the context of the end-game screen when you complete the maze, you are supposed to play the game by collecting 
all of the eggs.**
